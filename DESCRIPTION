Description: The PRobabilistic Enhancer PRedictIoN Tool (PREPRINT) finds
	genomic regulatory enhancers in Human DNA based on chromatin features.
	PREPRINT defines functions to extract characteristic coverage patterns
	surrounding known enhancer sites, build a statistical model to account for
	their variability. This model can then by used to produce probability
	scores for as yet unseen genomic regions.
